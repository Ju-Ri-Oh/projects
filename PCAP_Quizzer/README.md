Note: If libraries are outdated, a working bundled .exe -file exists on my Google Drive which is working but might give false positives on various Anti-Malware programs due to the natures of bundled .exe files created with python. File is large  (110 MB) because it includes the entire Python IDE to work as a standalone.
