This is my submission for the final project in the Masterschool Data Analytics program (Data Scientist track).

It focuses primarily on Machine Learning, but also Python(Pandas) and includes a tiny bit of SQL.

This project was developed in Google Collab using Jupyter Notebooks and copied to Github.
